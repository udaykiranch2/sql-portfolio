#### Project 1: Job posting Analysis

This SQL project is based on Data Analyst Job Postings [Pay, Skills, Benefits] dataset by Luke Barousse hosted on Kaggle.
This repository provides an SQL analysis of employment listings scraped from Google job search results. The dataset spans 
from November 4, 2022 through March 22 , 2024 using PosgreSQL.
The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into the skills that are frequently mentioned in the job descriptions,frequencyof job postings and basic salary statistics.
